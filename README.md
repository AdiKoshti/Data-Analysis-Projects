# Data Visualization Portfolio
This repository showcases my data visualization projects, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. The projects cover a range of topics, including:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization)
* Data Storytelling (communicating insights and findings through interactive dashboards)
* Data Science (machine learning, statistical modeling, and data mining)

#### Each project includes:
* A brief description of the problem and approach
* Code in Python, using popular libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh
* Results, including interactive visualizations and insights

#### My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:
* Collect, clean, and preprocess data for analysis
* Develop effective visualizations to communicate insights and findings
* Extract meaning and value from data through exploratory analysis and storytelling
